                  The story begins on Christmas Eve at the Stalhbaum family home, where the Stahlbaum children, Clara and Fritz, are excited to celebrate the holiday with family and friends. 
                  The family has invited Drosselmeyer, Clara's godfather, to entertain the guests with his lifelike mechanical dolls. After the entertainment, he pulls out a gift for Clara - a nutcracker in the shape of a soldier!
                  Clara is enchanted with her gift, and barely notices the end of the party. She wants to take it upstairs to bed with her, but her parents insist the new presents must stay downstairs, and Clara reluctantly complies.
                  In the middle of the night, Clara wakes up with a feeling of unease, and goes to check on her new toy. She finds the nutcracker in its place in the living room, and, suddenly tired, falls asleep on the couch.
                  As she sleeps, the furniture and toys in the living room grow larger - or perhaps she shrinks? - and huge, human-sized mice begin creeping in. Clara awakens with a start, and is terrified to see the huge mice advancing on her - and her nutcracker is nowhere to be seen.
                  Just as the terrifying Mouse King begins to advance, the Nutcracker, now also life-size, emerges leading his own troop of toy soldiers. Battle breaks out, and the Nutcracker's army overtakes the mice and drives them away. The Nutcracker takes on the Mouse King,
                  and in the struggle, the Mouse King seems to be getting the upper hand. Clara distracts the Mouse King by throwing her shoe at him, and the Nutcracker is able to land the killing blow, but he himself has been injured. Clara weeps, but suddenly notices that the toy has been replaced with a human prince,
                  and his injury is healed. He explains that Clara has helped break the curse trapping him in the toy's body, and he promises to lead her to his kingdom. The pair walk outside through a snowy forest, and soon reach the Land of Sweets, ruled over by the Sugarplum Fairy and her Cavalier. All the sweets in the kingdom
                  celebrate the victory, dancing all night. Clara soon grows tired, and falls asleep. She wakes up back in her own home, with her new toy beside her, realizing it was all a beautiful Christmas dream.

                  Giselle is a young peasant girl living in a German village. She has a weak heart, and so her mother has forbidden her from exerting herself too much, but she still loves to dance - particularly with Loys, a peasant boy
                  from a nearby village who sometimes visits her. Hilarion, another villager, is also in love with Giselle, and deeply jealous of this flirtation, tries to convince Giselle that the newcomer can't be trusted, but she doesn't believe him.
                  During the harvest festival, Giselle's mother tells the story of the Wilis, who are the spirits of women who died after being betrayed by their lovers. The Wilis are said to guard the nearby forest at night, trapping 
                  any men they come across and forcing them to dance until they die from exhaustion. As the story ends, a party of nobles arrives in the villages, tired from their hunt. Giselle and her mother offer them refreshment, and the duke's daughter, charmed by Giselle, gifts her a necklace.
                  The nobles leave the village to continue their hunt, and the village festivities go on as Giselle is crowned Harvest Queen and happily dances with Loys. Suddenly, Hilarion interrupts the festivities holding a noble's cape, hunting horn, and sword.
                  He claims to have found them hidden in the village, and accuses Loys of being a nobleman in disguise. Loys denies the accusation, and Giselle assumes it is simply Hilarion's jealousy at work. Hilarion blows on the horn, calling the noble hunting party 
                  back to the village. The nobles return, and the duke's daughter recognizes Loys - who is in fact a nobleman called Albrecht, and who is engaged to marry the duke's daughter. Shocked and betrayed, Giselle goes mad with grief, almost stabbing herself 
                  with Albrecht's sword. Hilarion snatches it away, but Giselle grows more frantic, collapsing in Albrecht's arms - her heart has given out, and she is dead. Hilarion and Albrecht turn on each other, each accusing the other of causing Giselle's death, 
                  and ALbrecht almost kills Hilarion before running from the village in horror. The second act opens in the forest graveyard, where Giselle has been buried. It is nighttime on the day of her burial, and Hilarion is mourning at her grave. Suddenly, 
                  mysterious lights appear around him, and he runs away in fear. The lights reveal themselves to be the Wilis, led by their queen Myrtha, who have come to induct Giselle's spirit into their fold. Albrecht arrives, wracked with guilt, and lays flowers 
                  at Giselle's grave. As he mourns, Giselle's spirit appears to him and accepts his pleas for forgiveness. Suddenly, Giselle is called to rejoin the rest of the Wilis; Albrecht desperately follows her spirit. The Wilis have caught 
                  up to Hilarion, and force him to dance until he collapses from exhaustion, then drown him in the forest lake. In his pursuit of Giselle's spirit, Albrecht runs into the Wilis' circle, and they turn on him as their next victim. Both Albrecht 
                  and Giselle plead for his life, but Myrtha refuses, declaring that he, too, must dance to death. However, the power of Giselle's love allows her to resist Myrtha's powers, and though she cannot defeat Myrtha and the Wilis, she shares Albrecht's 
                  burden, dancing in his place and supporting him as much as she is able, and manages to keep him alive until sunrise. The rest of the Wilis return to their graves, powerless during the day. Giselle, however, is released from the Wilis' sisterhood. She stays 
                  long enough to bid Albrecht farewell, then returns to her grave to rest in peace.

                  <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
